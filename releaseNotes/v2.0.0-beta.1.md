# SuperSocket.ProtoBuf 2.0.0-beta.1 Release Notes

We're excited to announce the first beta release of SuperSocket.ProtoBuf 2.0.0! This library provides efficient Protocol Buffers integration for SuperSocket, enabling high-performance binary serialization and deserialization for network messages.

## Features

- **Protocol Buffers Integration**: Seamless integration with Google Protocol Buffers for efficient binary serialization
- **Type Registry System**: Centralized type registry to manage message types and their unique identifiers
- **Pipeline Filters**: Custom pipeline filters to process incoming protobuf messages
- **Package Encoders/Decoders**: Built-in support for encoding and decoding protobuf messages
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple platforms including:
  - .NET 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0
  - Mobile platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, tvOS)

## Core Components

- `ProtobufTypeRegistry`: Central registry for mapping between message types and their identifiers
- `ProtobufPipelineFilter<T>`: Processes incoming data streams and extracts protocol buffer messages
- `ProtobufPackageDecoder<T>`: Decodes binary data into strongly-typed protocol buffer messages
- `ProtobufPackageEncoder<T>`: Encodes protocol buffer messages for network transmission
- Concrete implementations for direct `IMessage` handling

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
dotnet add package SuperSocket.ProtoBuf --version 2.0.0-beta.1
```

Check the [README](https://github.com/SuperSocket/SuperSocket.ProtoBuf/blob/main/README.md) for detailed usage examples and API documentation.

## Protocol Format

Messages are encoded with an 8-byte header followed by the protobuf message payload:
- First 4 bytes: Message size in big-endian format
- Next 4 bytes: Message type ID in big-endian format
- Remaining bytes: The serialized protobuf message

## Notes for Beta Users

As this is a beta release, we welcome your feedback and contributions:

- Please report any issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SuperSocket/SuperSocket.ProtoBuf/issues)
- API signatures may change between beta and final release
- Performance optimizations are ongoing
